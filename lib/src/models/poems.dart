On boring Monday morning,
on my train journey,
the girl on the train,
intelligent with her brain,
like a good wish,
her name is --

kind with her heart,
divine with her nature,
sweet with her words,
curious with her questions,
innocent with her actions,

beauty within her eyes,
believe me, not telling lies,
she sat besides me,
going to her uni,

from the central coast,
brightened my day,
and the week ahead,
the talks we had,
I was so glad,

I thought I got a date,
but separated by faith,
still her smile brought me peace,
no discomfort, I was at ease,

couple of stations passed by,
now the timing had come,
for me to get off,
then in my dreams she got lost,

before leaving, she asked,
Holy Bible, do you want,
the caring she showed,
I said yes, have you got.

Her motive was divine,
My motive was material,
divinity took over,
on all my thoughts interior,

There I got off,
still looking behind,
with kindness in her smile,
she made my eyes shine.

But I want to tell her,
Im a like water,
You will be the shape,
Which I will take,
I am a like a reflection,
Of you in the mirror,


I still am open minded,
I still believe in her,
Will pray to god for her,
& May god unite us.
